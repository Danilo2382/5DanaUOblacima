   git clone https://github.com/Danilo2382/5DanaUOblacima.git cd 5DanaUOblacima
   ```
3. **Build the project using Maven**:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
   This will compile the project and download all necessary dependencies.

## Running the Application

Once the project is built, you can run the application with the following command:
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, you can run the JAR file generated in the target directory:
```sh
java -jar target/PetDanaUOblacima-1.0.0.jar
```

By default, the application is served on port 8080. You can access it by navigating to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

1. **Import the Project**:
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Select **File > Open...**.
   - Navigate to the project folder (`5DanaUOblacima`) and open it.
   - IntelliJ will detect the Maven build configuration and automatically download all dependencies.

2. **Build the Project**:
   - Once the project is imported, go to the top menu and select **Build > Build Project** or use the shortcut `Ctrl+F9` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+F9` (Mac).
   - Ensure there are no errors in the build process.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Open the main class `5DanaUOblacimaApplication` (located in the `src/main/java` directory).
   - Right-click on the file and select **Run '5DanaUOblacimaApplication'**.
   - Alternatively, click on the green triangle icon next to the class name in the editor or in the project explorer.

4. **Access the Application**:
